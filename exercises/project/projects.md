# Group projects

You will work in groups of 3, with the composition determined by the random draw in the lectures. The main goal of the project is to get hands-on experience with the Bayesian optimization.

You can choose one of the following types of projects:  

1. Take some real world data and an algorithm that is relatively costly to evaluate, and use Bayesian optimization to optimize the hyperparameters, compare systematically with grid search or any other algo for hyperparameter search you know of.  
2. Take a different application that you like e.g. learning the user preferences and develop a code illustrating the application. Do your best to compare BO with alternative approaches.  
3. Take a deeper dive into the method - e.g. compare different acquisition or function learning methods, different prior in finding a solution, different optimization routines etc. For this task you should use some of the benchmark function where we know the solution (e.g. Brannin Hoo).  

The work does not need to be original, feel free to replicate a Bayesian optimization paper that you find interesting. I am fine with that, as long as you fulfil the goal of getting hands-on experience with BO. Careful with the underlying model that you will be optimizing and amount of data, no need to have a very costly problem.

To complete the assignment you should do the following:  

1. Write a brief report where you will present your findings. No need to write too much, but do not put only the figures without following them up with comments.  
2. Code up the analysis. I should be able to redo the analysis ideally with a single line command. Analysis can be implemented in any language, though, I do have a preference for R and Python. I value well organized, readable code with some basic documentation.  
3. Development of all the documents and the code related to the competition should be under version control using Github. It can be either a private or a public repository. I will check how well all of you have used it to organize your work, produce the reports and the code for the competition.  

You should grant me access to the repository as soon as possible and the state of the repository found on the deadline (**June 20, 11:59**) will be counted as a submission (indicate the main files I should look at in a Readme file).
